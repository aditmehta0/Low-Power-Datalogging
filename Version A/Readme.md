# Code Overview

**Version A**
Initialization:
The RTC SQW pin is configured to control a Pâ€‘channel MOSFET that supplies power to both the Arduino and SD card module.

The DS3231 RTC is initialized over I2C. (If the RTC isnâ€™t running, you might want to initialize it with the current compile time.)

Unique File Creation & Data Logging:
A filename is generated (e.g., DATA000.CSV, DATA001.CSV, etc.) by checking for file existence.
Five rows of data (timestamp and a simulated sensor reading) are written into this file.

RTC Alarm Setting:
After logging, an alarm is set for 10 minutes in the future. This alarm should trigger the external circuit (via the RTCâ€™s INT/SQW pin) to reapply power.

Power-Down / Deep Sleep:
The Arduino + Sd Card while it is still powered, power off is triggered over I2C by sending a reset alarm command to RTC.
With external circuitry, the RTC alarm can fully power off the Arduino and SD card between logging sessions.
